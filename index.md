This compilation of paleomagnetic data contains all currently published paleomagnetic rotation control points from the Cantabrian Zone of North Western Iberia (as of October 2021). It was originally compiled in 2019 as part of an MSc Resources and Exploration Geology thesis at Cardiff University looking at the kinematics and formation mechanism of the Cantabrian orocline. 

The database has been restricted to the Cantabrian Zone of North Western Iberia as it contains the vast majority of available paleomagnetic measurements. This is a consequence of its key location at the core of the larger Ibero-Amorican Arc, where the greatest change in structural trends is observed. On top of this the relative lack of metamorphism, well below Curie temperature for the main two ferromagnetic minerals haematite and magnetite and low internal strain in the rocks result in higher levels of integrity of the paleomagnetic vectors with respect to the more internal Variscan units *(Hirt et al., 1992; Brime et al., 2001)*. 

The data contained here came from 12 studies *(Bonhommet et al., 1981; Hirt et al. 1992; Pares et al., 1994; Ries et al., 1980; Schott and Peres, 1987; Stewart, 1995; Van der Voo et al., 1997; Weil et al., 2013; Weil et al., 2010; Weil, 2006; Weil et al. 2001; Weil et al., 2000)* as well as new currently unpublished data from the Villamanin area collected by Professor Thomas Blenkinsop (Cardiff University) and Tania Mochales (Instituto Geologico y Minero de Espana) during the summers of 2015 and 2016 at 13 sites across the Lancara, San Emiliana, La Vid, Barcallente and Barrios Formations. Overall 423 sites sampled for paleomagnetic investigation from Paleozoic redbeds and carbonates are presented here. Data was extracted from papers using the freely available software Tabula and has been laid out to be similar to the Pyrenean paleomagnetic database *(Lopez et al., 2008)*. The data fields try to assemble the information necessary to quantify the amount of vertical axis rotation the rocks have experienced, as well as evaluate the reliability and quality of the data based on the requirements laid out by Van der Voo (1990), allowing future overviews of the Cantabrian dataset.

This compilation of paleomagnetic data contains all currently published paleomagnetic roatation control point data from the Cantabrian Zone of North Western Iberia. It was originally compiled as part of an MSc Resources and Exploration Geology thesis at Cardiff University looking at the kinematics and formation mechanism of the Cantabrian orocline.

The data contained here has been restricted to the Cantabrian Zone of North Western Iberia as it contains the vast majority of available paleomagnetic measurements. This is a consequence of its key location at the core of the larger Ibero-Amorican Arc, where the greatest change in structural trends is observed. On top of this the relative lack of metamorphism, well below Curie temperature for the main two ferromagnetic minerals haematite and magnetite and low internal strain in the rocks result in higher levels of integrity of the paleomagnetic vectors with respect to the more internal Variscan units (Hirt et al., 1992; Brime et al., 2001).

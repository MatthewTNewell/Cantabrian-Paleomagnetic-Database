# Cantabrian Paleomagnetic Database
 
This compilation of paleomagnetic data contains all currently published paleomagnetic roatation control point data from the Cantabrian Zone of North Western Iberia. It was originally compiled as part of an MSc Resources and Exploration Geology thesis at Cardiff University looking at the kinematics and formation mechanism of the Cantabrian orocline.

The data contained here has been restricted to the Cantabrian Zone of North Western Iberia as it contains the vast majority of available paleomagnetic measurements. This is a consequence of its key location at the core of the larger Ibero-Amorican Arc, where the greatest change in structural trends is observed. On top of this the relative lack of metamorphism, well below Curie temperature for the main two ferromagnetic minerals haematite and magnetite and low internal strain in the rocks result in higher levels of integrity of the paleomagnetic vectors with respect to the more internal Variscan units (Hirt et al., 1992; Brime et al., 2001). 

The data presented here comes from 14 studies (Bonhommet et al., 1981; Hirt et al. 1992; Pares et al., 1994; Perroud and Bonhommet, 1984; Ries et al., 1980; 
Schott and Peres, 1987; Stewart,  1995; Symons et al., 2015; 
Van der Voo et al., 1997; Weil et al., 2013; Weil et al., 2010; Weil, 2006; Weil et al. 2001; Weil et al., 2000) as well as new currently unpublished data from the Villamanin area collected by Professor Thomas Blenkinsop (Cardiff University) and Tania Mochales (Instituto Geológico y Minero de España) during the summers of 2015 and 2016 at 13 sites across the Lancara, San Emiliana, La Vid, Barcallente and Barrios Formations in the vicinity of Villamanin.
